The Pause/resume and error handling features would help the organization admins who otherwise would need to perform copying and tracking of large volume of content manually

2.	What is different from AZCopy, Azure Export/Import Service or other Azure Storage explorers and this tool?
This tool is built to perform massive content migration (in hundreds of TBs/PBs) with high reliability, ease and high speed.
The tool allows for dynamic Blob creation, Pause/Resume of uploads, Separate list of Failed files and option for Restart

3.	How can I get the Storage Account name and Access Key?
Once a storage account is created under the Azure Subscription, under Access Control option, you can see 2 Access Keys. You can use any of those 2 values and test connection when you want to initiate the migration.

Depending on the type of issue that caused the upload failure, the Failed Files tab will have details in comment section. (for e.g. Source File not found, Network disconnected etc.)

Once all the content is migrated to Azure blobs, you can use Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer or any other Azure Explorers available in Azure Marketplace to view/update/download files.
